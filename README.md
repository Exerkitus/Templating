# Templating

## How to Use
To use the generator, simply run the following command,
```
python generateHTML.py "../Sheets/[path to question]"
```

Notes:
  - You must run the python script from the directory it is stored in (running `python [path to script]/generateHTML.py` causes problems for the script's imports)
  - The extra command line argument is optional and defaults to `question.json`

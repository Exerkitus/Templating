# Templating V2
These scripts will generate .xml files to be uploaded directly to mobius

## How to Use
To use the generator, simply run the following commands,
```
python generateQuestion.py "[path to question]"
python generateGroup.py "[path to folder containing sheets]"
```

*Note: uids are automatically attributed to each question and group to maintain the link with the files which live on the server.*
